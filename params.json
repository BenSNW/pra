{"name":"The Path Ranking Algorithm","tagline":"Matt Gardner's implementation","body":"PRA (Path Ranking Algorithm)\r\n============================\r\n\r\nAn implementation of the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) using GraphChi, a library for efficient\r\nprocessing of large graphs on a single machine.  This algorithm learns models that analyze a graph\r\nand predict missing edges of particular types.  The code here was used to run experiments in the\r\nfollowing papers:\r\n\r\n* Incorporating Vector Space Similarity in Random Walk Inference over Knowledge Bases.  Matt\r\n  Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Jayant Krishnamurthy, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2014.\r\n([website](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra))\r\n* Improving Learning and Inference in a Large Knowledge-base using Latent Syntactic Cues.  Matt\r\n  Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Bryan Kisiel, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2013.\r\n([website](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2013_pra))\r\n\r\nEach of these papers has a corresponding tag in the repository (called a \"release\" in github).  You\r\ncan check out that tag if you _really_ want to reproduce _exactly_ the experiments that I ran for\r\nthose papers (and I actually broke the emnlp2013 release by removing the jars that were stored in\r\nthis repo, to drammatically cut down download size...).  But you probably should just use the most\r\nrecent code - this codebase will run all of the methods used in those papers, if not with exactly\r\nthe same code.\r\n\r\nSee [the wiki](http://github.com/matt-gardner/pra/wiki/Documentation) for code documentation.\r\nPlease feel free to file bugs, feature requests, or send pull requests.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis code makes use of a number of other libraries that are distributed under various open source\r\nlicenses (notably the Apache License and the Common Public License).  You can see those\r\ndependencies listed in the pom.xml file.  The code under the src/ directory is distributed under\r\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (or, at your choosing, any later version of\r\nthat license).  You can find the text of that license\r\n[here](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI did a force push on the repository on September 15, 2014, to remove some old jar files that made\r\nthe download for this repository about 25MB.  Now it's about ~200KB.  I thought that breaking the\r\nhistory was worth it, given the small number of current users of the code, and the fact that I'm\r\nthe only one contributing right now.  What this means is that if you cloned the repository before\r\nSept. 15, 2014, and you want to update the repository, you're going to have to re-clone the\r\nrepository.  The good news is that it shouldn't be that big a deal, because you probably didn't\r\nmodify the code, and the download is now just 200KB.\r\n","google":"UA-55234491-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
