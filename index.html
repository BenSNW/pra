<a name="pra-path-ranking-algorithm" class="anchor" href="#pra-path-ranking-algorithm"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PRA (Path Ranking Algorithm)</h1>

<p>An implementation of the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) using GraphChi, a library for efficient
processing of large graphs on a single machine.  This algorithm learns models that analyze a graph
and predict missing edges of particular types.  The code here was used to run experiments in the
following papers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporating Vector Space Similarity in Random Walk Inference over Knowledge Bases.  Matt
Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Jayant Krishnamurthy, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2014.
(<a href="http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra">website</a>)</li>
<li>Improving Learning and Inference in a Large Knowledge-base using Latent Syntactic Cues.  Matt
Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Bryan Kisiel, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2013.
(<a href="http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2013_pra">website</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Each of these papers has a corresponding tag in the repository (called a "release" in github).  You
can check out that tag if you <em>really</em> want to reproduce <em>exactly</em> the experiments that I ran for
those papers (and I actually broke the emnlp2013 release by removing the jars that were stored in
this repo, to drammatically cut down download size...).  But you probably should just use the most
recent code - this codebase will run all of the methods used in those papers, if not with exactly
the same code.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://github.com/matt-gardner/pra/wiki/Documentation">the wiki</a> for code documentation.
Please feel free to file bugs, feature requests, or send pull requests.</p>

<a name="warning" class="anchor" href="#warning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WARNING</h1>

<p>I did a force push on the repository on September 15, 2014, to remove some old jar files that made
the download for this repository about 25MB.  Now it's about ~200KB.  I thought that breaking the
history was worth it, given the small number of current users of the code, and the fact that I'm
the only one contributing right now.  What this means is that if you cloned the repository before
Sept. 15, 2014, and you want to update the repository, you're going to have to re-clone the
repository.  The good news is that it shouldn't be that big a deal, because you probably didn't
modify the code, and the download is now just 200KB.</p>
