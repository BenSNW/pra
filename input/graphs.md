# Graph directory contents

This directory is generated by `ExperimentGraphCreator`.  You should not have
to mess with the contents of this directory yourself.  But for your
information, this is what is generally found in these directories.  It contains
the graph that's used by GraphChi, and some files for mapping between the
strings used in other parts of the configuration files and the integers that
are used in the graph.  Specifically:

* `graph_chi/`: This directory contains the graph file itself (`edges.tsv`) and
  some output from GraphChi's processing (sharding) of the graph.

* `edge_dict.tsv`: A mapping from relation strings to integers.  If you want to
  know how many edge types there are in the graph, the length of this file will
  tell you that.

* `node_dict.tsv`: A mapping from node string to integers.  Nodes in the graph
  correspond to KB entities and noun phrases, so if you want to know how many
  of those there are in the graph, the length of this file will tell you that.

* `num_shards.tsv`: This specifies how many shards GraphChi should use when
  processing the graph, and affects runtime.  I have some rough heuristics for
  setting this number in the graph creation code.
