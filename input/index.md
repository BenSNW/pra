# Input File Specifications

There are several different pieces of input to this code.  You can find
documentation for what those are and how they should be formatted here (as well
as a description of the output the code generates).  If you find any of this
documentation inadequate, please let me know via the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/matt-gardner/pra/issues), and I will update the
documentation.

Some of these pages refer to examples found in the [EMNLP data
download](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra).  I tried to link
to the [page](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra) every time I
mentioned [it](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra), but in case I
forgot anywhere, [here](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra) is
the [link](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra).
